This [*Insee Analyses*](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/8289238#onglet-2) develops and presents a typology of districts within Lyon's functional urban area, based on factors such as demographic composition, socio-economic status, and housing types. Additionally, we leverage mobile phone activity data to examine how various populations engage with their territory, analyzing hourly variations in spatial presence during weekdays and weekends, as well as overall movement patterns across the typology. By integrating mobile phone data with traditional national statistics, we contribute to a nuanced understanding of urban mobility and how residents interact with their local communities in the context of Lyon's functional area.
