## Topic of interest

My research is positioned at the intersection of **economic geography**, **urban economics**, and **transportation economics**. 

As an applied economist, I focus on analyzing how *structural transformations* — such as the rise of **telework** and the expansion of **high-speed rail** and **highway networks** — impact the *aggregated behaviors of economic agents*, including their **location choices**, **mobility patterns**, **collaboration dynamics**, and **consumption habits**.

***I am a data enthusiastic! I love to uncover the stories it can tell.*** It has led me to work with high-resolution datasets — both geographic and temporal — derived from mobile phone activity, card transactions, patent records, and transportation networks. Additionally, I work on developing novel datasets that recover the evolution of travel times by train and car in relation to the creation and expansion of high-speed rail and highway networks.
