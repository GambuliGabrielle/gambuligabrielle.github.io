## Topic of interest

I'm an applied economist specialized in spatial economics, with a focus on telework and transportation networks.

My work explores how technological and infrastructural changes reshape where people live, work, consume and collaborate.

Enthusiastic about data, I work with high-resolution geographic and temporal datasets, including mobile phone activity, bank card transactions, and patent records. I also build original datasets on the evolution of intercity travel times, following high-speed railways and highways roll-out.
