Mobile phone and card transaction data provide valuable insights into measuring individual presence and mobility. Mobile phone data offer continuous observation, while card transaction data reveal the underlying reasons for this presence through consumption activities. This research assesses the similarity and complementarity of mobile phone and card transaction data to evaluate whether detected presence aligns with consumption patterns. We analyze temporal and spatial variations in this relationship across different days, times, and geographic areas (city centers, urban and rural suburbs). Additionally, we integrate data from Insee to explore which types of amenities, such as shops and transportation infrastructure, are most strongly associated with presence and consumption patterns. Finally, we analyze the causal impact of rare events on foot traffic and consumption, focusing on major cultural and sporting events that act as centripetal forces, as well as adverse weather conditions and traffic disruptions that proxy for increased travel costs.
