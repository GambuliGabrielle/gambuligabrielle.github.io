Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic, telework has become a common and lasting work practice, relocating presence from workplaces to residential areas several days per week. This spatial reorganization likely affects where in-person consumption occurs. This paper provides the first empirical assessment of the day-to-day impact of telework on local consumption in the post-pandemic period, offering insights into how hybrid work reshapes urban economic activity. We use data from the Lyon Functional Urban Area (FUA), France’s second-largest metropolitan area, in September 2022.

We develop a novel methodology to estimate daily telework intensity at the municipality level by combining mobile phone location data, labor force survey, and population census data. This allows us to capture both the increased presence at home and absence from workplaces throughout the week.

Using bank card transaction data, we show that while telework boosts weekday consumption in residential areas, it only partially offsets losses near workplaces. On average, 72% of workplace spending losses are recovered at home, resulting in a net decline in weekday consumption, especially in the urban core. Sectoral impacts vary: restaurants suffer the most (34% substitution), while bars and food retail see gains (above 100%). 

Consistent with the observed gains in food retail activity on weekdays, we find evidence that teleworkers partially shift consumption from weekends to weekdays, particularly within their residential neighborhoods.
