Since the COVID-19 pandemic, telework has become a permanent feature of labor markets, with 20% of French workers now teleworking 2-3 days per week. While prior studies have examined how telework affects spending near residences or workplaces, its net economic impact remains unclear: Does telework merely redistribute consumption, or does it reduce total economic activity? Using novel mobile phone location data and card transaction records from Lyon metropolitan area, France’s second-largest region, we provide the first two-sided assessment of telework’s effects. We find that a 1-percentage-point increase in working-from-home presence raises local spending by 1%, while a 1-percentage-point increase in workplace absence reduces it by 1.3%, yielding a net 3% decline in aggregate consumption across the Lyon metropolitan area. Challenging previous assumptions, consumption at home only partially substitutes for consumption at the workplace, indicating that telework represents a net economic shock. The effects are spatially heterogeneous: urban cores lose 6.8% in transactions, while residential suburbs gain. Sectorally, restaurants decline by 24%, but bars and food retail benefit. These results imply that telework is reshaping urban economies, with significant implications for urban planning, retail policy, and economic geography.
