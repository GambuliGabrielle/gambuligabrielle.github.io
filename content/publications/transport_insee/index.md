This [*Insee Analyses*](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/8580905#onglet-2)  analyzes commuting patterns and modes within Lyon’s functional urban area, integrating a district typology from a previous Insee Analyses. It shows that over two-thirds of workers commute by car, with a median travel distance of 10 km. Young professionals in central Lyon tend to favor active modes of transport, such as walking and cycling, while lower-income workers in suburban areas rely more heavily on public transit. Meanwhile, wealthier families living in suburban houses predominantly use cars due to longer commutes and limited public transport availability. Additionally, by leveraging mobile phone activity data, the study captures variations in commuting flows throughout the weekdays.
