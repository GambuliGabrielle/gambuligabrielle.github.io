This paper studies the impact of the introduction of high-speed railways (HSR) on innovation collaboration between inventors. We use patent data of the European Patent Office from 1980 to 2010 to observe collaboration at the inventor level on one hand. On the other hand, we construct a novel dataset of city-to-city travel time by train in France. Using the gravity equation and fixed effects models, we estimate the effect of a connection to HSR and of the reduction in travel time on inventors collaborations between NUTS3 regions. We also explore the heterogenous effect of travel time reductions on core regions and the periphery. In addition, we estimate the collaborative border effect, which refers to asymmetries in inventors' collaboration patterns between versus within regions. Results show that, a 1\% reduction in travel time for a pair of regions is expected to increase the amount of collaborations by 0.6\% for core regions, but the effect is lower for collaborations between core regions and the periphery. In addition, we find that the regional border effect decreases after a region is connected to the HSR. Difference-in-difference models confirms our results from the gravity equation.
