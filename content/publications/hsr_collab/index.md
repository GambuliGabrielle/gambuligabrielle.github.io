This paper provides new causal evidence of the impact of train travel time on patent collaboration between inventors. We construct a novel dataset of train travel times in France between 1980 and 2010 and exploit the roll out of High Speed Railways (HSR) as a quasi-natural experiment. The median decrease in travel time of 12% led to a 2.6% increase in patent collaborations across commuting zones. The effect on the increase in collaborations was stronger for most productive commuting zones and the most productive inventors within them, increasing the collaboration gap across and within regions.
