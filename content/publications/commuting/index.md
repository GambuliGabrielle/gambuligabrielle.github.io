This paper studies the impact of France's high-speed rail network on workers' commuting and relocation decisions, with respect to both their workplace and residence. The research draws on data on workers from "DADS Panel tout salari√©", and on train travel time (Gambuli and Stipanicic, 2023). Specifically, I employ a gravity model to estimate the effect of a reduction in travel time on commuting patterns adjustments across NUTS3 regions. Then, I examine the factors that drive these shifts in patterns, seeking to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of such changes on spatial dynamics. Notably, the study examines transitions both from urban to rural environments and vice versa, considering both residential and workplace locations, as well as firm mobility, and changes in skills and wages at destination workplaces relative to the origin. Additionally, the research explores the relationship between travel time and exposure to telework. Overall, the goal of this study is to identify the factors that influence workers' relocation decisions and understand the impact of high-speed railways on spatial dynamics.
