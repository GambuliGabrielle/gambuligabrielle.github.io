This paper explores the influence of the French high-speed rail (HSR) network on workers' decisions related to workplace and residence. Utilizing data from the DADS Panel tout salari√© and train travel time data from Gambuli and Stipanicic (2023), I employ a gravity model to measure the impact of reduced travel time on commuting adjustments between French departments (NUTS3 regions). Recognizing that HSR-affected department pairs still display long travel time for daily commuting, the analysis integrates considerations for telecommuting opportunities made feasible by internet connectivity. Stratifying the study by socio-professional categories accounts for varying telecommuting possibilities among worker groups. The findings indicate a growing tendency among workers, including executives, employees, and blue-collar workers, to choose separate and distant locations for residences and workplaces. This shift is attributed to both improved territorial connectivity through HSR and enhanced internet access. The combination of these factors offers both convenience and cost reduction for commuting, acting as mutually reinforcing elements.
