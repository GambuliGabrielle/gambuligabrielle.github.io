Welcome! I’m Gabrielle Gambuli, a **Postdoc Research Fellow** at Université Gustave Eiffel (Grettia) and Insee (Innovation Lab). I contribute to works on the [MobiTIC ANR project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-19-CE22-0010) and the [Chaire Finance Digitale](https://digital-finances.com/) at Télécom Paris.

My current research focuses on how telework reshapes daily mobility and in-store consumption by leveraging mobile phone and bank card transaction data.
