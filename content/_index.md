Welcome to my website! 

I'm an **applied spatial economist** focusing on the effect of transportation and telework on mobility and consumption.

I’m a **postdoc research fellow** at Université Gustave Eiffel ([Grettia](https://grettia.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/accueil)) and [Insee](https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil) (Innovation Lab). I contribute to works on the [MobiTIC ANR project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-19-CE22-0010) and the [Digital Finance Chair](https://digital-finances.com/).

In November 2025, I will be joining the [Economic Department of Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/labs/innovation-i3/economics) (CREST) as a postdoc.

My [job market paper](https://gambuligabrielle.github.io/publications/consumption-telework/) investigates how telework reshapes daily mobility and in-store consumption by leveraging mobile phone data and bank card transaction data.
