Anamorphic maps are a unique way of visualizing spatial data. They distort the shape of locations to reflect a specific variable, such as population density or economic activity. This approach can provide a fresh perspective on familiar geographic features and reveal new patterns and insights.

As part of my research, I study the evolution of train travel times in France, which have substantially decreased with the high-speed rail network. To illustrate those changes, I've used anamorphic techniques that distorts the distances between french cities.

Discover in the image above how the French high-speed railway has improved travel time from Paris to other cities between 1980 and 2017, and see cities that have become more accessible.
